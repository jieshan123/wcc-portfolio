                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>This project is a game built using P5.js that uses the gyroscope of the mobile software to control the movement of the ball, by jumping and avoiding obstacles to achieve further challenges and increase speed. The game is designed to be played on mobile devices and is intended to be a fun and engaging way to challenge yourself while also exploring the capabilities of the gyroscope as a control mechanism.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>This project was inspired by the desire to explore new and innovative ways of interacting with technology. The use of the gyroscope as a control mechanism provides a unique and intuitive way to control the movement of the ball in the game. The game is also inspired by endless runners, where the goal is to score the highest possible score by traversing obstacles.</p>
                <p>The medium for transforming objectively unrealistic game situations into subjectively realistic ones is the human fantasy, the imagination. Games are an interactive and dynamic medium. This interactivity allows game designers to appropriately represent the cause-and-effect relationships of reality change. As a result, game players can interactively explore the reality of the game. Crawford argues that this interactivity is a key factor in the appeal of computer games.(Kasvi, 2000)</p>
                <P>For background research, we reviewed various resources related to P5.js and gyroscope-based games. We found that P5.js is a popular tool for creating interactive and creative web-based projects, while gyroscopes can be used as a control mechanism for games and other interactive experiences. In addition, I researched various resources related to game design and game mechanics in order to create an engaging and challenging gaming experience.</P>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>

                <!-- example of styling for three images, you can write your own styling -->
                
                <p> The technical implementation of this project involved several different components. Firstly, I utilised the P5.js library to create the game and handle the rendering and animation of the various game elements. I also utilised the gyroscope functionality of the phone in order to allow the player to control the movement of the ball by tilting the phone in different directions. And swinging the phone to achieve ball jumps. </p>
                <p>According to Crawford, the game is a closed formal system that subjectively represents a subset of reality. A well-designed game rule explicitly covers all the contingencies that can be encountered in the game.</p>
                <P>In terms of design decisions, I chose to make the game an endless treadmill style game where the goal is to achieve the highest score by traversing obstacles. I also included a speed up feature, a jump feature where players can experience more exciting speeds to add to the experience and extend their gaming experience.</P>
                <P>One of the challenges I encountered during the implementation of this project was ensuring the responsiveness and accuracy of the gyroscope controls. We had to experiment with various settings and sensitivity levels in order to find the best balance between responsiveness and accuracy.</P>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>In reflecting on the development process and the final product of the gyroscope-controlled game, there were several areas that i felt went well, and others that i identified as potential areas for improvement.</p>
                <p>One aspect of the project that i was particularly happy with was the incorporation of the gyroscope as a control mechanism. It provided a unique and engaging way to control the movement of the ball, and allowed for a level of interactivity that wouldn't have been possible with traditional touch or button-based controls. Additionally, i felt that the endless runner game mechanics were well-suited to the gyroscope control scheme, and provided a fun and challenging experience for the player.</p>
                <P>However, one area that i identified as a potential area for improvement was the visual design and aesthetics of the game. While I was able to create a functional and engaging gameplay experience, i felt that the overall visual design could have been more polished and dynamic. Specifically, i would have liked to add more visual effects and feedback, as well as improve the overall color scheme and visual layout.</P>
                <P>Another area that i identified as a potential area for improvement was the overall gameplay mechanics. While the endless runner game mechanics were well-suited to the gyroscope control scheme, ii felt that there could have been more variety in the obstacles and power-ups. Specifically, i would have liked to add more types of obstacles and hazards, as well as more power-ups and bonuses that the player can collect.</P>
                <P>Looking to future development, i believe that there are several directions that this project could be taken in order to further explore the potential of gyroscope-controlled games. One potential avenue for development would be to experiment with different types of gameplay mechanics and control schemes. For example, i could explore the use of the gyroscope in more complex or puzzle-based games, where the player would need to manipulate objects or solve puzzles using the gyroscope.</P>
                <P>Another area of potential development would be to further explore the social and competitive elements of the game. For example, i could incorporate leaderboards and social sharing capabilities in order to foster competition and engagement among players. Additionally, i could experiment with multiplayer modes, where players could compete against each other in real-time using the gyroscope controls.

                    Overall, i believe that this project provided a strong foundation for future development and exploration in the area of gyroscope-controlled games and interactive experiences. With further development and refinement, i believe that this type of game could provide a unique and engaging gameplay experience for players, and could pave the way for new and innovative uses of gyroscope technology in gaming and beyond.
