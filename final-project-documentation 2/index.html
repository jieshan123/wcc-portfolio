                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>The game aims to provide a fun and challenging way to challenge oneself and at the same time explore the potential of gyroscopic control. The code implements a 3D game based on GyrOSC data, where the player can move and interact with the ball by tilting the phone to manipulate it. A new gameplay feature has been added to collect food and gifts to increase distance or gain 10 seconds of protection in order to avoid enemies and score higher.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>

                <p>This project was inspired by an exploration of innovative ways to interact with technology. The use of GyrOSC as a control mechanism provides a unique and intuitive way to manipulate the movement of a ball in a game. The game is also influenced by the endless runner genre, which requires the player to obtain a high score by traversing obstacles.</p>
                <p>The transformation of objectively unrealistic game scenarios into subjectively immersive experiences stems from human imagination and fantasy. Games as an interactive and dynamic medium allow designers to accurately represent the cause and effect of real-world changes. Crawford argues that this interactivity is a key factor in the appeal of video games (Kasvi, 2000)</p>
                <p>In terms of background research, this involved an examination of various resources related to P5.js and GyrOSC-based games.P5.js is recognised as a popular tool used to create web-based interactive and creative projects, while GyrOSC are used as a control mechanism for games and other interactive experiences. In addition, game design and mechanics were studied to ensure the creation of engaging and challenging game experiences.</p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>

                <!-- example of styling for three images, you can write your own styling -->
                
                <p>The technical implementation of the project involves several different parts. Firstly, the P5.js library is used to create the game and handle the rendering and animation of various game elements. Secondly, using the gyrosc function of the mobile device, the player can control the movement of the ball by tilting the mobile phone. In addition, jumping of the ball is achieved by shaking the mobile phone.</p>
                <p>Consistent with Crawford's view, a game is a closed formal system that subjectively represents a subset of reality. The carefully designed rules of the game contain all the contingencies that may be encountered (Kasvi, 2000).
                <p>In terms of design decisions, the game was designed as an endless runner style, where the player traverses obstacles to achieve the highest score. Features such as acceleration and jumping were also incorporated to increase excitement and extend gameplay time. The area of improvement lies in the overall game mechanics. While the mechanics of Endless Runner are well suited to the gyrosc control scheme, there is room for more variation in terms of obstacles and power-ups. Specifically, the hope is to add more types of obstacles, hazards, and energy and rewards that players can collect.</p>
                <p>Based on an existing project, I introduced the concept of coloured gift blobs. Upon collision, these gifts give the player a 200 distance boost or a 10 second protection. During the protection time, the ball will not be affected by barriers.</p>
                <p>One of the challenges I encountered during the implementation of the project was ensuring the responsiveness and accuracy of the gyrosc controls. This needed to be done by experimenting with different settings and sensitivity levels to find the best balance between responsiveness and accuracy. Another challenge was that when connecting to certain public networks, the reception of gyrosc data could be unstable, causing the connection to fail.</p>
                <p>Overall, I am satisfied with the technical implementation of the project and believe it provides users with an immersive and innovative gaming
                    experience.</p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>The current game has a simple interface, a comfortable user experience, and responsive controls. Future directions include expanding the game into an online or multiplayer game, although this is a complex and lengthy process.</p>
                <p>I am particularly pleased with the implementation of the gyroscope as a control mechanism in this project. It provides a unique and engaging way to manipulate the movement of the ball, allowing for a degree of interactivity that is not possible with traditional touch or button controls. Additionally, I found the game mechanics of Endless Runner to be a perfect fit for the gyroscope control scheme, providing a fun and challenging experience for the player.
                </p>
            <p>However, I found that the visual design and aesthetics of the game could use improvement. While I managed to create a functional and engaging gameplay experience, I think the overall visual design could be more polished and dynamic. Specifically, I would like to add more visual effects and feedback and improve the overall colour scheme and visual layout.
            </p>
            <p>Looking ahead, potential areas of development include exploring the social and competitive elements of the game. Integrating leaderboards and social sharing features could promote competition and interaction between players. In addition, a real-time multiplayer mode could be experimented with, where players can compete against each other using gyroscopic controls, albeit a complex process. In addition, more game reward mechanisms can be further introduced to enrich the gaming experience.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, I believe that this project has laid a solid foundation for future development and exploration in the field of gyroscope-controlled games and interactive experiences. Through further refinement and development, I believe that this type of game can provide players with a unique and engaging gaming experience, while paving the way for innovative applications of gyroscope technology in gaming and other fields.</p>
